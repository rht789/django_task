7. ORM
7.1 
Django ORM s a tool to manipulate database by python code
its benefit:
1. reduce complexity in code
2. make code more understable
3. help us get more in less time

Django Debug Toolbar:
Django Debug Toolbar is a configurable set of panels that display various debug information about the current request/response in your Django web application. It is a powerful tool for developers to monitor and analyze what happens under the hood when a page is rendered, helping them identify performance bottlenecks, database query issues, template rendering problems, and more.

The toolbar appears as a small sidebar on the side of your webpage (usually on the right) when you're running your Django project in DEBUG mode . Each panel provides detailed insights into different aspects of your application's behavior during a request.

Why Do We Use Django Debug Toolbar?
Database Query Analysis :
One of the most important features of the toolbar is its ability to show all SQL queries executed during a request.
It highlights slow queries, duplicate queries, and helps optimize database interactions by providing details like query execution time, number of queries, and query structure.
This is crucial for improving performance, especially in applications with complex database operations.
Performance Monitoring :
The toolbar provides timing information for various stages of the request/response cycle, such as view processing, middleware execution, and template rendering.
This helps developers identify bottlenecks and optimize the performance of their application.
Template Debugging :
It shows which templates were used to render a page, including context variables passed to each template.
This is helpful for debugging template-related issues, ensuring that the correct data is being passed and rendered.
Cache Inspection :
If your application uses caching, the toolbar can display cache hits, misses, and other cache-related statistics.
This helps developers fine-tune their caching strategy to improve performance.
Request/Response Inspection :
You can inspect the HTTP headers, GET/POST parameters, cookies, and session data associated with the current request.
This is useful for debugging issues related to user input, authentication, or API integrations.
Signals and Logging :
The toolbar can display information about Django signals that were triggered during the request.
It also integrates with Python's logging system to show log messages generated during the request.
Custom Panels :
Developers can create custom panels to display additional information specific to their application.
For example, you could create a panel to monitor third-party API calls or track memory usage.
Ease of Use :
The toolbar is easy to install and configure, making it accessible even for beginners.
Its intuitive interface allows developers to quickly access the information they need without diving into logs or writing custom debugging code.

7.2
Reset Database in Django:
To reset a dtabbase in, we need to delete the current database in PostgreSQL then also in migrations foler delete all previous file except __init__.py then create a new database on pgadmin then make and apply migration and its done so new models will be:
from django.db import models

# Create your models here.

class Employee(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    email = models.EmailField(unique=True)
    
    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

class Task(models.Model):
    STATUS_CHOICES = [
        ('PENDING', 'Pending'),
        ('IN_PROGRESS','Pending'),
        ('COMPLETED','Completed')
    ]
    project = models.ForeignKey("Project", on_delete=models.CASCADE, default=1)
    assigned_to = models.ManyToManyField(Employee)
    title = models.CharField(max_length=250)
    description = models.TextField()
    due_date = models.DateField()
    status = models.CharField(max_length=15, choices=STATUS_CHOICES, default="PENDING")
    is_completed = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    
    def __str__(self):
        return self.title
    
class TaskDetail(models.Model):
    HIGH = 'H'
    MEDIUM = 'M'
    LOW = 'L'
    PRIORITY_OPTIONS = (
        (HIGH , 'High'),
        (MEDIUM, 'Medium'),
        (LOW, 'Low')
    )
    # std_id = models.CharField(max_length=200, primary_key=True)
    task = models.OneToOneField(Task, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    assigned_to = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    priority = models.CharField(
        max_length=1,choices=PRIORITY_OPTIONS,default=LOW
    )
    notes = models.TextField(blank=True,null=True)
    
    def __str__(self):
        return f"Details from Task {self.task}"
    
class Project(models.Model):
    name  = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    description = models.TextField(blank=True, null=True)
    start_date = models.DateField()
    
    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
now by default Django sets a primary key in a id field but we can also set it manually by 
task_id = models.CharField(max_length=200, primary_key=True)

7.3
Retreiving data:
Now we can't create every single data with Django shell manually for that reason we will use faker, Faker is python package, now with this along side our ORM we have made ths which we will run in our dango shell by importing it first then the function populate_db() here is the code we place it in root folder and in file named populate_db.python :
import os
import django
from faker import Faker
import random
from tasks.models import Employee, Project, Task, TaskDetail

# Set up Django environment
os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'task_management.settings')
django.setup()

# Function to populate the database


def populate_db():
    # Initialize Faker
    fake = Faker()

    # Create Projects
    projects = [Project.objects.create(
        name=fake.bs().capitalize(),
        description=fake.paragraph(),
        start_date=fake.date_this_year()
    ) for _ in range(5)]
    print(f"Created {len(projects)} projects.")

    # Create Employees
    employees = [Employee.objects.create(
        name=fake.name(),
        email=fake.email()
    ) for _ in range(10)]
    print(f"Created {len(employees)} employees.")

    # Create Tasks
    tasks = []
    for _ in range(20):
        task = Task.objects.create(
            project=random.choice(projects),
            title=fake.sentence(),
            description=fake.paragraph(),
            due_date=fake.date_this_year(),
            status=random.choice(['PENDING', 'IN_PROGRESS', 'COMPLETED']),
            is_completed=random.choice([True, False])
        )
        task.assigned_to.set(random.sample(employees, random.randint(1, 3)))
        tasks.append(task)
    print(f"Created {len(tasks)} tasks.")

    # Create Task Details
    for task in tasks:
        TaskDetail.objects.create(
            task=task,
            assigned_to=", ".join(
                [emp.name for emp in task.assigned_to.all()]),
            priority=random.choice(['H', 'M', 'L']),
            notes=fake.paragraph()
        )
    print("Populated TaskDetails for all tasks.")
    print("Database populated successfully!")
we then created a method in views to view all tasks along sde a template named view_task.html which are def view_task(request):
    tasks = Task.objects.all()
    return render(request, "view_task.html", {"tasks": tasks})
and <!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div>
        <ul>
            {% for task in tasks %}
                <li>{{task}}</li>
            {% endfor %}
        </ul>
        
    </div>
</body>
</html>

now we can also show only one task by get method by using id or pk (pk=0 won't work) we can't pass a specific type as context doesn't support multiple object passing in html also get the first task by first() method 
def view_task(request):
    tasks = Task.objects.all()
    task = Task.objects.get(id=1)
    task1 = Task.objects.first()
    taskpk = Task.objects.get(pk=1)
    return render(request, "view_task.html", {"tasks": tasks, "task":task, "taskpk":taskpk, "task1":task1})

7.4 Filtering Data
By filter method we can sent multiple data in context to the template where we would use filter and to not show any type we will use exclude in the code examples are given to look more method here is the reference https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/ref/models/querysets/ and the code is: 
def view_task(request):
    """Show all taskes"""
    # tasks = Task.objects.all()
    """Show tasks that are pending"""
    # tasks = Task.objects.filter(status="PENDING")
    
    """SHow tasks that are not in low priority"""
    tasks = TaskDetail.objects.exclude(priority="L")
    return render(request, "view_task.html", {"tasks": tasks})
7.5
More filtering but specific requirement (lookups)
exact - Finds an exact match of a field’s value.
tasks = Task.objects.filter(title__exact="Open")
iexact - Finds an exact match (case insensitive)
tasks = Task.objects.filter(title__exact="open")
contains = Checks if a field contains a given value (case-sensitive)
tasks = Task.objects.filter(title__contains="O")
icontains = Same as contains, but case-insensitive.
tasks = Task.objects.filter(title__icontains="o")
in - Checks if a field’s value is inside a list of values.
tasks = Task.objects.filter(prority__in=["HIGH","MEDIUM"])
gt-find values greater than a value
gte-find values greater than a value or equal
lt-find values less than a value
lte-find values less than a value or equal
show an example related to our project
startswith - Finds fields that start with a given value (case-sensitive).
tasks = Task.objects.filter(title__startswith = "A")
istartswith - Finds fields that start with a given value (case-insensitive).
tasks = Task.objects.filter(title__startswith = "a")
endswith and iendswith is same as startswith and istartswith but the ending word must have the query
range - find values between two numbers
show example
isnull - finds value that are nulls 
show example
exists - returns true or false based on available result

and(&) or(|) XOR(^) to use this we need to import Q from django.db.models write about these with example
